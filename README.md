A crowd-sourced immersive language learning mobile app.  
<br>

### Objective
The goal of this app is to allow two types of users to translate provided scenarios in selected languages. The Content Provider (CP) provides prompt and answer translations (text and audio) of a selected scenario for Languages Learners (LL) to interact with. The Language Learner can read and play scenario prompt translations (provided by the CP) and practice answering the prompts in the selected language via audio recording or text input. The LL’s answer is graded against the CPs answer and a success or failure is reported to the LL.
